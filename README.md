# ID_PrimaveraV10_CodeSnippets

## Repository of Class Libraries written to extend the functionality and workflow of Primavera ERP v10.0. 

### Made to fulfill different customers requests to improve and minimize their company's workload. 
#### Being a large corporate application, Primavera works with a lot of dependencies/references; these are added and commented, respectively, at the top. You might also find commented blocks of code. These are test scenarios that require minimal program interaction to work (compared to the final solution) while giving the same result, facilitating testing.<br></br>
